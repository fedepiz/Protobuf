# Protobuf
Protocol Buffers for Standard ML

NOTE:
In order to use any of the files in the project but TestRun.sml and Comparisons.sml, write the statement: 

	use "Load.sml";

This  will import all the other files in the correct order.

As a software library, Protocol Buffers for Standard ML does not have a logical entry point. In order to test the main features of the project, please read and use the demonstration files "TestRun.sml" and "Comparisons.sml", which are also referred to in the dissertation text.
